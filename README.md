### How to Run
To start, run `cd wikismart` to get to the correct folder. Then, run `npm i` to install all necessary packages needed. To start the interface, run `npm start`. There is no personal API-key you need to generate to run this interface.

### API Used
I used Wikipedia's MediaWiki API for this project to query user and random article searches. The API was able to give me information, including article title, a preview, a thumbnail, and related links.
