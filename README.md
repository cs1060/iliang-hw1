### How to Run
To start, run `cd wikismart` to get to the correct folder. Then, run `npm i` to install all necessary packages needed. To start the interface, run `npm start`. There is no personal API-key you need to generate to run this interface.

### API Used
I used Wikipedia's MediaWiki API for this project to query user and random article searches. The API was able to give me information, including article title, a preview, a thumbnail, and related links. 

### Contributions and Issues
This project was created by Ivy Liang. It took around 4-5 hours. Getting the API backend was actually the easy part; however, I would say that I could not find much documentation on the Wikipedia API, and had to rely on a single block of example code to learn. The real hard part was formatting the landing page and post-search page to be exactly how I wanted it. I attempted to use ChatGPT and gave it my code for context, but it was unhelpful.
